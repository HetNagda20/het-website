#Hey I'm Het
Iâ€™m a software engineer and MSCS student at UIC who loves building things that are clean, reliable, and actually useful. Right now Iâ€™m focused on cloud-hosted AI features and data-heavy systemsâ€”the kind that need good interfaces and good internals. I previously worked at Accenture on production systems, and Iâ€™m now leveling up in databases, systems, and applied ML during grad school.




## Currently
- Grad courses at UIC (2024â€“2026): databases, randomized/approx/parallel algorithms, data ethics, visualization.  
- Exploring **query processing**, **LLM infra**, and practical **cloud ops**.  
- Open to **SDE internships (Fall 2025)** and **new-grad roles (2026)**.

## A few tools I like
**Python, Java, C/C#, JavaScript (ES6+), SQL, Scala** Â· **Django, Flask, React, TensorFlow, Unity** Â·  
**AWS (Lambda, EC2, S3, API Gateway), Docker** Â· **Linux, GitHub, VS Code**

Say hiâ€”always happy to chat about systems, data, and building neat tools.
