# Hey, I'm Het ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer and MSCS student at **UIC** who loves building things that are clean, reliable, and actually useful.  
Right now Iâ€™m focused on **cloud-hosted AI features** and **data-heavy systems**â€”the kind that need good interfaces *and* good internals.

I previously worked at **Accenture** on production systems, and Iâ€™m now leveling up in databases, systems, and applied ML during grad school.

---

## What I do
- **Ship small, solid services**: clear APIs, observability, and docs people can follow.  
- **Make data useful**: from storage layers to reporting that non-engineers can trust.  
- **Blend AI practically**: LLMs where they help, guardrails where they matter.
