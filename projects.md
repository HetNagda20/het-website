# Projects & Case Studies

Here’s a selection of work I’ve done across **AI, systems, and full-stack development**.
Each one pushed me to learn something new and build tools that are both usable and reliable.

## 🤖 Conversational LLM Agent with AWS Microservices (Fall 2024) {#llm-agent}
A full-stack conversational AI agent integrating a **locally hosted Ollama** model with **AWS Bedrock**, orchestrated via microservices.  
**Stack:** AWS (EC2, Lambda, S3, API Gateway), Akka HTTP, Protobuf, Ollama

- Integrated a locally hosted Ollama model with Bedrock for hybrid inference.
- Built **Akka HTTP** microservices with **Protobuf** serialization for efficient cloud comms.
- Deployed **Lambda** via S3 and exposed via **API Gateway** to talk to EC2 services.

👉 *Takeaway:* Blending **local + cloud** LLMs with scalable microservices.

## 🎮 Game-Based Learning for Traffic Signs
An interactive driving simulation that gamifies road safety education.  
**Stack:** Unity, C#, Physics Engine  

- Built physics-based vehicle controls + adaptive difficulty.  
- Implemented scoring + real-time feedback to boost engagement.  
- Used in classrooms with **300+ students**, with a data-logging system for teachers.  

👉 *Takeaway:* Blending **game design + education** taught me how feedback loops can make learning stick.

## 🏭 Garment Management System
A full-stack inventory and billing system for small manufacturers.  
**Stack:** Django, Python, JavaScript, SQL/NoSQL  

- Real-time tracking of raw materials, invoices, and sales.  
- Integrated robust reporting features for financial + inventory insights.  
- Designed a UI usable even by non-technical staff.  

👉 *Takeaway:* Gave me early experience in **end-to-end system design** and taught me the value of usability.

# ✨ More to Come
I’m actively working on projects around **databases, query processing, and systems infra** as part of my grad studies at UIC.  
Stay tuned 👀
